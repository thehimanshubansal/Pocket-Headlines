# Pocket-Headlines
Pocket Headlines is a Python-based news aggregator that fetches and displays the latest news from the NewsAPI. Users can choose between top headlines or explore news from specific categories, making it a versatile and real-time news-fetching tool. I had built it while I was learning python from Code with Harry. Amazed to know about NewsAPI and python libraries, Request and JSON.
